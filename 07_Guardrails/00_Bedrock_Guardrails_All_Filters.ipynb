In addition to these protections, Guardrails lets you configure thresholds across the different categories to filter out harmful interactions. Increasing the strength of the filter increases the aggressiveness of the filtering. Guardrails automatically evaluate both user queries and FM responses to detect and help prevent content that falls into restricted categories. For example, an ecommerce site can design its online assistant to avoid using inappropriate language, such as hate speech or insults."
