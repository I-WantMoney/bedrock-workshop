# Lab 10 - Introduction to Function calling with Claude2 via Amazon Bedrock

This lab will walk you through the basics of function calling via Claude models to the Amazon Bedrock service using Python. 

First, ensure you've completed the setup in the ['Getting Started' section of the root README](../README.md#Getting-started)

Then, you'll be ready to walk through the notebook [bedrock_boto3_function_calling_claude2.ipynb](bedrock_boto3_function_calling_claude2.ipynb), which shows how to install the required packages, connect to Bedrock, and get setup for function calling with Bedrock.

Before running any of the labs ensure you've run the [Bedrock boto3 setup notebook](../00_Intro/bedrock_boto3_setup.ipynb#Prerequisites).
