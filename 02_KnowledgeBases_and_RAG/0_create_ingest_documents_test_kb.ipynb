    "# Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock - End to end example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides sample code for building an empty OpenSearch Serverless (OSS) index, an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base, and ingest documents into the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notebook Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "A data pipeline that ingests documents (typically stored in Amazon S3) into a knowledge base i.e. a vector database such as Amazon OpenSearch Service Serverless (AOSS) so that it is available for lookup when a question is received.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the documents into the knowledge base by connecting your s3 bucket (data source). \n",
    "- Ingestion - Knowledge base will split them into smaller chunks (based on the strategy selected), generate embeddings and store it in the associated vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "![data_ingestion.png](./images/data_ingestion.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps: \n",
    "- Create Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base execution role with necessary policies for accessing data from S3 and writing embeddings into OSS.\n",
    "- Create an empty OpenSearch serverless index.\n",
    "- Download documents\n",
    "- Create Amazon Bedrock knowledge base\n",
    "- Create a data source within knowledge base which will connect to Amazon S3\n",
    "- Start an ingestion job using KB APIs which will read data from s3, chunk it, convert chunks into embeddings using Amazon Titan Embeddings model and then store these embeddings in AOSS. All of this without having to build, deploy and manage the data pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is available in the Bedrock Knowledge Base then a question answering application can be built using the Knowledge Base APIs provided by Amazon Bedrock in following notebooks in the same folder. \n",
